# Learning Objectives

This project focuses on the following learning objectives:

## Parametrizing Flask Templates for Language Display

In this project, you will learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages. You will explore techniques to dynamically render templates based on the user's language preference. This will allow your application to provide a localized experience to users from different regions.

## Inferring the Correct Locale

You will also learn how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers. By detecting the user's preferred language, you can ensure that your application displays content in the appropriate language without requiring explicit language selection from the user.

## Localizing Timestamps

Another important aspect of internationalization is localizing timestamps. You will learn how to format timestamps according to the user's preferred locale. This will enable your application to display dates and times in a way that is familiar and meaningful to users from different cultures.

By mastering these concepts, you will be able to create web applications that can adapt to the language and cultural preferences of your users, providing them with a personalized and localized experience.
